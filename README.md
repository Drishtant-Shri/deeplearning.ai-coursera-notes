# deeplearning.ai-coursera-notes
Compiled notes for the deeplearning.ai specialization on Coursera. Taught by Andrew Ng

Link to the course: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

I intend to continuously add to and improve these notes as I complete the [5-course specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). See [here](https://johngiorgi.github.io/deeplearning.ai-coursera-notes/) for the notes compiled as a simple website.
